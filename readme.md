## Overview:
	This project implments segmentation on handwritten maths expressions
	and then performs classification on each of the segmented symbols.
	There are multiple python scripts that compute different tasks at
	for this project. The stages include:
	- Removing the information from each of the inkml files such as
	  uid, traces, traceGroup
	  performs preprocessing on the traces
	  generate features for each of the strokes and its edges
								**(prepare.py)

	- Splitting the extracted features into train and test set
	  with a 70%-30% split ratio using KL divergence metric
								  **(split.py)

	- Train the data on Random Forest and/or 
	  Support vector machine classifier for segmentation
								  **(train.py)

	- Segment the features generated by *prepare.py* file and for each
	  segmented traces classify the symbol		   
							      **(segmentor.py)

	- From the predictions generate a .lg file
							  **(convert_to_lg.py)


	There are two models used for this project:
	1. For segmentation: 	Random Forest
	2. For classification:	Random Forest
	The second model for classification is from project 1.

## Running instructions:
	- Make sure to have all the dependencies installed before running
	  the program. The dependencies are mentioned in the requirements.txt
	  file. To install these into your python environment do:
	  cmd: pip install -r requirements.txt

	- Written a makefile which will implement all the necssary files 
	  to test you samples. However, need to pass few params.

	- Input should be path to dir where inkml files are present or
	  the inkml file itself

	- The output will be a .lg if a single file is passed or a list of
	  .lg files for all the inkml files present in the directory

	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. To pass a single inkml file:
	```cmd: make INKML=<path-to-inkml-file>```
	- obtain .lg file for the inkml file

	2. To pass dir(s) consisting of inkml files:
	```cmd: make INKML=<path-to-dir(1)> <path-to-dir(2)>```
	- obtain .lg files for all inkml file
        
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
	If need to perform other tasks such as splitting, or
	running the bonus set
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

	3. To implement splitting of data into training and test set
	cmd: make prepare split INKML=<path-to-inkml dir> 
	
	4. To implement bonus section and run bonus model
	cmd: make INKML=<path-to-inkml/dir> BONUS=y
    
	5. To implement project2 classifier
	cmd: make p1_train P1_train=<dir path to project1 data>
    
	5. To implement project2 classifier
	cmd: make p1_train P1_train=<dir path to project1 data>
    
	6. To implement project2 classifier for bonus section
	cmd: make p1_train P1_train=<dir path to project1 data> BONUS=y

## Output:
	- The output will be present in the *data/lg* folder.

	- It should contain .lg file(s)


## LgEval & Confusion Hist:
	- These results are for the 30% test set
	- LgEval metric summary file is present in the outputs.zip
	- Confusion Histogram .html
